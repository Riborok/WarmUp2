# WarmUp â„–2. Bacteria
---
### Task:
![The task](https://i.imgur.com/P3pSQaM.png)

>The program calculates the amount of red and green bacteria after all clock ticks and their total amount.

#### Language: Delphi

## There are 2 variants: using recurrence relation and binet formula

---

### Code using recurrence relation:
#### This variant monitors the overflow of variables. In case of overflow, displays the previous values.
``` pascal
Program WarmUp2;
{
 There are red and green bacteria. Red turn green in one tact of time.
 Green in one tact of time are divided into two: red and green.
 Find the amount of red and green bacteria, and the total amount.
}

  //Green - amount of green bacteria in the current tact of time.
  //NewGreen - the amount of green bacteria after one tact of time.
  //Total - total number of bacteria
  //Tacts - total amount of tacts
  //k - counter for tacts of time
  //Overflow - overflow check
